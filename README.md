# aws-terraform-ansible

Notes/code for the course [Deploying to AWS with Ansible and Terraform](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/187) on LinuxAcademy.

Unfortunately, the course is/was quite outdated. I fixed some things that no longer worked on the fly,
and it is still a helpful start, but it is not the best course ever ;)
